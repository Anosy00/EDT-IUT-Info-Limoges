# Fork of `pdf2json`

`pdf2json` is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) module that parses and converts PDF from binary to JSON format, it's built with [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/) and extends with interactive form elements and text content parsing outside browser.

## Why a fork ?

The original project converts units, even though we want to keep the original units.
This fork is a workaround to keep the original units.
